Plan for VandyHacks!

Project breakdown:
    1. Capture webcam in python 
    2. Modify video stream
        a. Google cloud API (getting data from frame)
        b. Overlaying images on the frame
            i. Time based pop-ups (factory pattern)
                1) Too much time
                2) You look sad
                3) Pay attention!
            ii. AR environment
                1) Super mario styled - grab gold coins
                2) Image editing in GIM (Jack)
                3) Overlay pixelated filter
    3. Game logic
        a. Integrated with video
        b. Controlled with emotions or head movement
        c. Mask RCNN
        d. Box to track head like snap cam git
        e. Retro style
    4. Stream to virtual camera

Class based structure: (Everything runs in infinite loop)
    - Get frame from webcam
    - Send to process frame fn
        - Makes decision on what to do with state
        - Updates state
        - Return new frame with overlay
    - Get frame frome fn and send to virtual camera
** State diagram **
    - Control object that maintains state
    - Start method begins infinite loop
